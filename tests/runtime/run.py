"""Exercise production driver code with host stubs and require full coverage of it.

Each fixture names a source file, the functions whose lines and branches it
gates, and any further functions it only needs in order to compile. They are
lifted out of the source, under #line markers that keep their real file and
line numbers, into tests/runtime/<fixture>_harness.c in place of its
/* DRIVER_FUNCTIONS */ marker. The harness supplies stand-ins for Zephyr and
ZMK and drives the functions. Every line and branch inside a gated function
must run, measured from gcov's per-line report rather than its per-file total,
so a support function is compiled in without being held to it.

A name may end in ":2" to lift the second of two definitions -- the other
side of an #if -- and a name starting with "#define " lifts that macro.
