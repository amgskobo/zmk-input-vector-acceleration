# Module-owned tests

Run from this checkout. Docker + Bash is the host entry point; no keyboard
checkout, shared test dispatcher or simulator repository is required.

```bash
bash tests/run-docker.sh
ZMK_TEST_MODE=full bash tests/run-docker.sh
```

On PowerShell, set `$env:ZMK_TEST_MODE="full"` for the second command
and invoke Git Bash explicitly. Remove the variable for the default quick run.

Quick executes **all behavioral fixtures and scenarios** once with
AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Full repeats those same assertions
under the retained optimization, coverage and (where already present) 32-bit
variants. CI uses quick for push/PR and full for scheduled/manual runs.
Unknown mode values fail; there is no silent skipped success.

## Retained behavioral contracts

| Fixture | Assertions |
| --- | --- |
| [test_vector_accel.c](test_vector_accel.c) | Gain interpolation, vector direction, saturation and rounding |
| [runtime/driver_harness.c](runtime/driver_harness.c) | Frame timing, independent histories and persistence callbacks |
| [runtime/driver_ram_harness.c](runtime/driver_ram_harness.c) | RAM-only persistence variant |
| [runtime/custom_settings_harness.c](runtime/custom_settings_harness.c) | Custom-settings persistence owner |
| [test_runtime_coverage.py](test_runtime_coverage.py) | Actual runtime entry rejects empty, unrelated and partially measured gcov reports |

The core also checks monotonic and backwards transitions across the full signed
timestamp range. A span beyond the history window resets velocity without a
signed subtraction overflow, for both opening and closing a frame. This is a
pure timestamp-domain regression, not evidence of a board clock fault.

Each fixture keeps its existing normal, boundary/invalid, independent-state,
reset/cancellation and failure/recovery scenarios where applicable. Checks
assert ordered outputs and explicit time inputs. Coverage is a full-mode gate,
not a reason to replace assertions or a hardware completeness claim.

Both host modes and CI run the synthetic coverage-admission controls. Each
gated real function needs measured executable lines; macro expansions remain
measured in their callers. Normal full runs retain actual compiled line/branch
measurement and all behavioral assertions. Recording tools prove admission,
not firmware behavior.

## Separate integration and physical contracts

Keep the existing owner `run-integration-docker.sh` commands and accepted
upstream/DYA variants for changed APIs, DTS/Kconfig/registration or actual
kernel boundaries. Native fixtures and negative guards are retained. Do not
run all firmware variants for a pure arithmetic edit. Host extracted functions
and controlled work queues do not prove real scheduling or transport delivery.

## Retired legacy simulation

The active `tests/bsim` directory was removed on 2026-10-05. Before removal,
every source and ordered snapshot was SHA256-verified in an external archive.
Its retirement manifest retains the raw traces and assertion mapping. Archive
locations belong to the consuming keyboard integration repository and are not
a prerequisite for these module-owned checks.
No failed snapshot was accepted as passing.

| Retired case | Behavioral replacement | Transport boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| split-steady | The owner fixtures above retain state/arithmetic/error assertions | Ordered physical split/HID/LED/battery delivery and timing: pending actual-device evidence |

For the affected case, exercise the same contact/layer/settings/power or
congestion/reconnect transition on the production board. Capture each report
value/order/timestamp and verify balanced releases and specified deadlines.
Do not mark the archived exact radio trace as covered by a host stub.

## Current test ownership and compatibility

Run the relevant public interface/build checks on both unchanged stock ZMK
and DYA when this owner supports both. See the selected core in the manifest.

Canonical entries (run from the repository root):

```bash
bash tests/run-docker.sh
```

[maintenance.json](maintenance.json) records supported cores, current commands
and explicit gaps. It is a reference map, not a passing test or a claim that
registration/coverage totals establish completeness. Preserve ordered outputs,
raw timestamps and the first failure. Read actual dependencies before execution.

## Explicit offline integration

The existing `tests/integration/run.sh` also accepts an already resolved cache
through `ZMK_TEST_OFFLINE_WORKSPACE`, with a fresh `ZMK_TEST_OUTPUT` directory.
Run this entry inside the same build image with the module mounted at `/src`.
The offline path makes an isolated west workspace using the original fixture
manifest, an unchanged local Git clone of ZMK and symlinks to cached dependencies; it never fetches or patches
the core. Exact supported core, Zephyr and required library revisions and clean
source state are checked before a build; existing outputs are rejected.
The combined processors/vector runners also require
`ZMK_TEST_OFFLINE_UPSTREAM_WORKSPACE`. Other runners select `upstream` or `dya`
as their first argument (the inertia default remains upstream).

DYA fixtures that enable custom settings require
`ZMK_TEST_CUSTOM_SETTINGS_ARCHIVE`: the SHA256-checked git archive of the pinned
`c6a7fef3a3be3d3ace5de9a4b0628c6418cd1f3f` test dependency, without local edits.
The accepted archive digest is recorded in `tests/integration/offline.py`.
All existing fixture assertions and cases run unchanged after preparation.
Outputs inside source/dependency roots, including parent-symlink aliases,
are rejected before creating output. Project paths must not overlap one
another or west/config metadata. Sibling outputs and external dependencies
remain supported. The host/CI entry runs these rejection fixtures in both modes.
Test offline admission and rejection with
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/integration -p test_offline.py -v`.
Core updates require an explicit pin review rather than an implicit fetch.

The preparation uses Linux symlinks and runs inside the documented build image.
`ZMK_TEST_OFFLINE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL=skip-identity` in the admission test command
intentionally bypasses dependency identity validation; its rejection tests must fail.

A complete offline run in the build image uses both selected cores:

```bash
ZMK_TEST_OFFLINE_WORKSPACE=/resolved/dya \
ZMK_TEST_OFFLINE_UPSTREAM_WORKSPACE=/resolved/upstream \
ZMK_TEST_CUSTOM_SETTINGS_ARCHIVE=/resolved/custom-settings-c6a7fef.tar \
ZMK_TEST_OUTPUT=/tmp/vector-acceleration-integration-v1 \
bash /src/tests/integration/run.sh
```
